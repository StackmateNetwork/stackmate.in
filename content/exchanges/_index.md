### OTC: Over the counter

OTC Exchanges provide all the liquidity on the platform and users BUY/SELL directly with the platform.

> Better for non-traders (3 clicks to  BUY)

OTC's have the advantage of being very simple to use, but usually charge a premium for this convenience. 

### P2P: Peer-to-Peer (Orderbook)
P2P Exchanges facilitate users briniging their own liquidity to the platform and collectively create an orderbook to trade amongst each other. 

`P2P became the defacto after the regulatory uncertainty, post 2017 in India; to legally protect the platforms.`

> Better for traders (9+ clicks to  BUY)

P2P Orderbooks tend to give you a better rate but have a small initial learning curve. Better for traders
