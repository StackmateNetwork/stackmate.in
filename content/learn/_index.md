### A tool for social evolution

We often find ourselves projecting hatred towards money. Poverty is often seen as a side-effect of it. However, it is not money, rather <em>fiat</em> money, that has created this reputation. Since the 1970's the US, and rest of the world, moved off the gold standard to a fiat standard. Fiat is essentially money backed by debt and promises that can be enforced with lethal weapons by a centralized issuing body - aka a government.<b> Fiat is a fundamentally rigged system that relies on trust.</b>

It is not the fault of any one single individual, rather of a system that continously corrupts the incentives of man. 

<b>A bitcoin standard fundamentally changes economic and social incentives.</b>

<b>When the value you set out to create in this world, is rooted in a sound money, it changes how you approach the world.</b>

For civilization to advance, we must be able to freely collabate towards seeking the truth and forwarding science. Bitcoin has provided, and continues to expose us to the tools and information to begin <b>building a freedom preserving digital infrastructure</b> that will lay the foundation for this pursuit. 

Bitcoin is the only instance of a <b>globally decentralized & immutable</b> ledger of economic activity. The digital equivalent of </b>carving facts into stones</b>.

### A decentralized payment network
> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. - Nakamoto (2008)

Bitcoin is a network of individuals aka peers, maintaining a financial ledger by a certain set of rules aka a monetary policy. The monetary policy is enforced by peers collectively agreeing on which software best enforces thhis policy - currently [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and which platforms to conduct technical & social discussions on - currently [Github](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) , [Twitter](https://twitter.com) or messenger pigeons. 

A peer running a version of [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin), maintaining the entire ledger, and validating transactions as they are broadcasted to the network, are called full-nodes (fully validating nodes). The number and distribution of full-nodes on the network is one of the key components of a decentralized network. 

<b>The ease and inexpensiveness of running a full-node is what determines a network's ability to maintain and grow in decentralization over time.</b>

Changes to the software that full-nodes run is a very slow process in bitcoin and this is to protect the monetary policy from arbitrary changes. Not only are changes to the code slow, but also, full-nodes updating to new software to fully enforce the new changes also takes a while. While this can make Bitcoin seem slow and boring, this is what gives it reliability. It is a feature not a bug. More interestingly, it is a social phenomenon which cannot be replicated by any technology and is exactly what makes the entire experience of bitcoin the most grounded. 

The first property of a sound money is to be a reliable <b>store of value</b> (SOV). 

By providing a stable and predictable monetary policy, the Bitcoin network achieves this property through its thick skinned resistance to change as a monetary network.

- Bitcoin Maximum Supply - <b>~21 Million BTC</b> (FOREVER)

Only after a money can reliably store value, does it begin its journey towards achieving its second property of being a <b>medium of exchange</b> (MOE). To facilitate an almost infinite throughput of transactions, Bitcoin delegates this to "Layer 2". 

Layer 2 is a sub network maintained by Bitcoin nodes, that operate by a different set of more flexible rules. 

It requires Bitcoin to be locked up on the main network with specific conditions, allowing a temporary representation of BTC on another network, in a different form. Think of this as how cash used to represent actual gold locked in a vault.

Layer 2 operates with less security guarentees for infiniately scalable transaction throughput. 

Examples of some native layer 2 solutions include: 

- [Lightning Network](https://blockstream.com/lightning/) - Payment infrastructure
- [Liquid](https://blockstream.com/liquid/) - Digital Asset Issuance
- [Elements](https://blockstream.com/elements/) - Federated Side Chains

Smart contracting platforms built on Bitcoin:

- [BlockStack](https://www.stacks.co/)
- [RootStock](https://www.rsk.co/)
- [RGB](https://rgb-org.github.io/)

### A new monetary base

> Precious metals and collectibles have an unforgeable scarcity due to the costliness of their creation. This once provided money the value of which was largely independent of any trusted third party. Precious metals have problems, however. It's too costly to assay metals repeatedly for common transactions. Thus a trusted third party (usually associated with a tax collector who accepted the coins as payment) was invoked to stamp a standard amount of the metal into a coin. - Szabo (2005)

The final stage of a money, after proving itself as a medium of exchange, is <b>unit of account</b> (UOA). When we begin to think in this money. 

Civilizations have always converged to a single unit of account, a monetary base unit in which to price all goods and services produced. In the past, this unit was gold. Gold found its value in its scarcity as a natural resource and expensive cost of production. Today, the US Dollar has taken the position of unit of account and finds its value purely in promises backed by force and debt. 

*USD settlements take 3+ days on the base layer called FedWire.*

Bitcoin achieves finality within 10 minutes.

Fedwire is also a network, with ~ 9000 participants (Paypal, Stripe etc.), who collectively provide the a fiat payment infrastructure.

Bitcoin will serve a similar purpose, where [nodes](https://bitnodes.io) will service Layer 2 solutions to build a new digital infrastructure built on a sound monetary base.
