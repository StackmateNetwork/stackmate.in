### A tool for social evolution

We often find ourselves projecting hatred towards money. Poverty is often seen as a side-effect of it. However, it is not money, rather <em>fiat</em> money, that has created this reputation. Since the 1970's the US, and rest of the world, moved off the gold standard to a fiat standard. Fiat is essentially money backed by debt and promises that can be enforced with lethal weapons by a centralized issuing body - aka a government.<b> Fiat is a fundamentally rigged system that relies on trust.</b> 

It is not the fault of any one single individual, rather of a system that continously corrupts the incentives of man. 

<b>A bitcoin standard fundamentally changes economic and social incentives.</b>

<b>When the value you set out to create in this world, is rooted in a sound money, it changes how you approach the world.</b>

For civilization to advance, we must be able to freely collabate towards seeking the truth. Bitcoin has provided, and continues to expose us to the tools and information to begin <b>building a freedom preserving digital infrastructure</b> that will lay the foundation for this pursuit. 

Bitcoin is the only instance of a <b>globally decentralized & immutable</b> ledger of economic activity. The digital equivalent of </b>carving facts into stones</b>.

### A global decentralized network of peers

> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. - Nakamoto (2008)

Bitcoin is a network of individuals aka peers, maintaining a financial ledger by a certain set of rules aka a monetary policy. The monetary policy is enforced by peers collectively agreeing on which software to run - [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and which platforms to conduct technical & social discussions on - currently [Github](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) , [Twitter](https://twitter.com) or messenger pigeons. 

A peer running a version of [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin), maintaining the entire ledger, and validating transactions as they are broadcasted to the network, are called full-nodes. 

Changes to the software that peers run is a very slow process in bitcoin and this is to protect the monetary policy from arbitrary changes. Not only are changes to the code slow, but also, nodes updating to the new software to fully enforce the new changes takes a while. While this can make Bitcoin seem slow and boring, this is what gives it reliability.

The first property of a sound money is to be a reliable store of value. 

By providing a stable and predictable monetary policy, the Bitcoin network achieves this property through its think skinned resistance to change as a monetary network.

- Bitcoin Maximum Supply - <b>~21 Million BTC</b> (FOREVER)

Only after a money can reliably store value, can it be a reliable base on which business infrastructure can be built. This is when a money begins to strengthen its second property of being a medium of exchange. To facilitate an almost infinite throughput of transactions, Bitcoin delegates this to "Layer 2". 

Layer 2 is a sub network maintained by peers on the Main Network. Layer 2 operates with less security guarentees but infiniately scalable transaction throughput. 

### A chain of digital signatures

> We define an electronic coin, as a chain of digital signatures. - Nakamoto (2008)

Bitcoin nodes maintain a shahred ledger aka a chain - tracking movement of coins from one individual's lock (address) to another's. Each block in the chain can be thought of as a page on a ledger. The state of this chain can be altered by providing a valid digital signature to unlock coin and subsequently lock it to an address of a new owner. This way, an electronic coin at any one point in time, is represented by a chain of signatures that led to its current owner. We pass on of the ability to sign a new page on a global ledger, where our private key (a very large prime number), is in essence, a <b>cryptographic pen</b>.

### A new monetary base

> Precious metals and collectibles have an unforgeable scarcity due to the costliness of their creation. This once provided money the value of which was largely independent of any trusted third party. Precious metals have problems, however. It's too costly to assay metals repeatedly for common transactions. Thus a trusted third party (usually associated with a tax collector who accepted the coins as payment) was invoked to stamp a standard amount of the metal into a coin. - Szabo (2005)

The final stage of a money, after proving itself as a medium of exchange, is unit of account. When we begin to think in this money. 

Civilizations have always converged to a single unit of account, a monetary base unit in which to price all goods and services produced. In the past, this unit was gold. Gold found its value in its scarcity as a natural resource and expensive cost of production. Today, the US Dollar has taken the position of unit of account and finds its value purely in promisary notes and debt. 

*USD settlements take 3+ days on the base layer called FedWire.*

Bitcoin achieves finality within 10 minutes.

Fedwire is also a network, with around 9000 participants (Paypal, Stripe etc.), soon to be surpassed by Bitcoin, with its currently roughly 9000 nodes, and a much lower barrier to entry.
