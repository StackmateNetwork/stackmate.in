### A tool for social evolution

We often find ourselves projecting hatred towards money. Poverty is often seen as a side-effect of it. However, it is not money, rather FIAT money, that has created this reputation. `Fiat is a fundamentally rigged system.` This means, the incentives of those who take part in this system are rooted from biased first principles. 

`A bitcoin standard fundamentally changes economic incentives.` The debt based fiat economy is the cause of half the worlds problems today, where a few advance at the expense of the many. It is not the fault of any one single individual, rather from our collective acceptance of such a system that corrupts the incentives of man. 

For civilization to advance, we must seek the truth, and Bitcoin has provided us with the tools and memes to begin doing so. 

Bitcoin is the only instance of a `decentralized & immutable` ledger of economic activity. The digital equivalent of `carving facts into stones`.


### A global decentralized payment network

> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. - Satoshi (2009)

Bitcoin is a network of individuals (peers) maintaining a financial ledger, by a certain set of rules (consensus); thereby enforcing a protocol around it. We all collectively agree on which software to run - [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and which platforms to conduct technical & social discussions on - currently [Github](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) & [Twitter](https://twitter.com). 

Bitcoin peers are spread across the globe and hold common values for what constitutes a sound monetary base aka money. These values are hard to change, just like the properties of natural elements like gold.  While this can make Bitcoin seem slow and boring, this is what gives it reliability.

### A chain of digital signatures

> We define an electronic coin, as a chain of digital signatures. - Satoshi (2008)

All the way down, on the technical level. Bitcoin is a ledger of payment conditions (locks, represented by addresses). The state of this ledger can be altered by providing a valid digital signature to unlock coin and lock it to a public key of a new owner (their bitcoin address). This way, an electronic coin is represented as a constant passing on of the ability to sign on a global ledger, where your private key (a very large prime number), is essentially a special pen that can unlock a certain set of locks aka bitcoin addresses.

### A new monetary base

> Precious metals and collectibles have an unforgeable scarcity due to the costliness of their creation. This once provided money the value of which was largely independent of any trusted third party. Precious metals have problems, however. It's too costly to assay metals repeatedly for common transactions. Thus a trusted third party (usually associated with a tax collector who accepted the coins as payment) was invoked to stamp a standard amount of the metal into a coin. - Szabo (2005)

Civilizations have always converged to a single unit of account, a monetary base unit in which to price all goods and services produced. In the past, this unit was gold. Gold found its value in its scarcity as a natural resource and expensive cost of production. Today, the US Dollar has taken the position of unit of account and finds its value purely in promisary notes and debt. 

*USD settlements take 3+ days on the base layer - fedwire.*

A visa transaction being confirmed within seconds, does not represent final settlement.

Bitcoin achieves finality within 10 minutes.

On top of this settlement layer, new layers can emerge, which will make various tradeoffs to cater to the specific needs of an individual.

The base layer, is a purely backend matter.

Owning BTC, is taking part in consensus of a new global monetary standard.

#### Layer 2

Most of us do not know, or care about (by virtue of trust in) the mechanics of the USD base layer - `fedwire`, which impacts the backend valuation of all our local currency transactions. In much the same way, in a Bitcoin standard, daily transactions will not require settlement or interaction on the base layer from the user's end. 

Daily transactions will take place on Layer 2 or sidechains.

The ledger on the base layer only allows 1MB of data to be entered every 10 minutes.

A single transaction is roughly 200B on average. 

Now, this transaction could either be one of two cases:
1. Private Key Lock - Requires an individual to sign in order to move coins
2. Script Lock - Requires a more complex condition to be satisfied to move coins

Most of us are familiar with the first case, which is a regular case of Alice paying Bob.
It takes 10 minutes, and that is too slow for daily transctions, especially if Alice and Bob regularly transact.

This is where we mpve into layer 2, where spending conditions involving multiple parties can be created which can provide enough guarentees to all parties to conduct activity on a side-chain or another protocol that can make sense of this Script Lock. 

This is how bitcoin scales.

Where 200B can represent a 1-to-1 payment, servicing only two individuals in a Private Key Lock,
the same 200B can represent a multi-party payment channel, servicing any number of individuals to transact at lightning speed and with as much frequency as they so chose in - on a side-chain that is secured by a Script Lock bitcoin transaction on the main chian. 

Alice and Bob can transact at almost no fees, almost instantaneouly on a side-chain where all their micro transactions then finally get summed and settle on the main chain into a 200B tx that encapsulated long periods of off-chain activity; with the added side effect of privacy over micro transactions.

Examples of this include:
- Lightning Network
- WBTC on Ethereum/Cardano etc.

The bitcoin base layer must always support decentralization, which means keeping the size of blocks small so that new peers can join the network and easily run a full node and maintain a copy of the entire ledger.

This protects the network for coordinated attacks and ensures much higher availability and reliability than any centralized or weakly decentralized system.
