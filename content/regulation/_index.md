# Regulation

Amidst all the FUD being spread over mass media, it is important to understand that

####  YOU expended TIME and ENERGY to create value in this world; it is your birth right to preserve it in the medium you see fit; be it a very large number, a metal, a rock, a piece of paper, promises or whatever YOU choose.

> “Only 13% of our planet’s population is born into the dollar, euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar or Swiss Franc. The other 87% are born into autocracy or considerably less trustworthy currencies. 4.3 billion people live under authoritarianism, and 1.2 billion people live under double- or triple-digit inflation.” – Alex Gladstein (2021)

* For regulatory simplicity, Bitcoin can be treated like gold or silver.
