### Stackmate Privacy Model (simplified)


- Privacy is a default in all stackmate systems. Users can opt-out for conveniences.



- We do not collect personally identifiable information on users, unless provided so by the user, in exchange for an extended service.


- Users have the ability to delete their accounts, and completely purge all traces of their wallets and their UID associated with it (from backups too!).
