- Your profile (personally identifiable data) is made up of an email address and request source IPs.

- With respect to bitcoin, our current mode of operation requires your public key. This creates an association between your xpub and your profile - therefore fingerprinting related bitcoin transactions.

- You have the ability to delete your profile, and completely purge your profile data from backups as well.
