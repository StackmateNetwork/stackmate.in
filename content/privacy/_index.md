### Stackmate Privacy Model (simplified)


- We are our first clients, and we hold Privacy with high regard.

- We do not collect or store personally identifiable information on users, unless provided so by the user, in exchange for an extended service. In such cases, personal data on a user is encrypted at rest with a password set by the user - preventing even us from accessing it without the user decrypting it. If a user finds this causing an inconvenience, they are easily able to opt-out.

- We will not share a users peronally identifiable information with any third party without the consent of the user. Where an extended service requires sharing information with a third-party that does not offer the same degrees of privacy, we will clearly present the risks to you, prior to requesting your consent.

- Users have the ability to delete their accounts, and completely purge all traces of personally identifiable information (from backups too!) that can associate user identity with our transaction data. 

- With respect to bitcoin, by sharing your xpub with our server and associating it with an email and source IP, you are fingerprinting all related transaction data. You can work around this by using a private email and running our client behing Tor.

- We currently DO NOT SHARE any user information with any third party.
