### Stackmate Privacy Model

> We are our first clients, and we hold Privacy with high regard.

- To create an account with us you only require a valid email address, which can be anonymous. This is only required for authentication and updates. 

- We do not require any personally identifiable information.

- Where personally identifiable information is shared, in exchange for an extended service; it is handled in compliance with International Privacy laws like GDPR.

- You always have the ability to delete your account, and completely purge all traces of your profile (from backups too!). This will remove all associations of your profile with public bitcoin transaction data.

- With respect to bitcoin, by sharing your public key with our server and associating it with your profile - email and source IP per request - you are fingerprinting bitcoin transactions with your profile. You can work around this by using a private email and running our client behind Tor. If you begin to get paranoid, you may delete your account and breathe.

- We DO NOT derive analytics from personally identifiable data.

- We currently DO NOT SHARE any user information with any third party.

- We WILL NOT SHARE a user's peronally identifiable information with any third party without the consent of the user. Where an extended service requires sharing information with a third-party that does not offer the same degrees of privacy, we will clearly present the risks to you, prior to requesting your consent.
