### What do you mean by private?

- To create an account profile and use the basic features, we require a valid email address.

- With respect to bitcoin, our current mode of operation requires sharing your public key with our server. This association of an xpub to a profile - fingerprints related bitcoin transactions. You can work around this by using an anonymous email and running our client behind Tor. If you're starting to get paranoid, request to delete your account and breathe.

- You always have the ability to delete your account, and completely purge your profile data from backups as well. This will remove all associations of your profile with public bitcoin transaction data.
