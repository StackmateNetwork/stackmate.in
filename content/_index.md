# Stackmate India

Amidst all the noise of 1000+ digital assets, it is easy to lose sight of the importance of `Bitcoin` - the only one that can be considered a safe store of value - the strongest candidate for a new global monetary base.  

Our mission is to simplify the process of recognizing, buying & storing Bitcoin as an anti-fragile, wealth preservation asset and tool for social change.


Our core team of early Bitcoiners, designers and information security researchers, are dedicated to supporting India on its journey towards building a symbiotic relationship with the Bitcoin network.


## Zero-Sum

Money (not currency) is a zero sum game. 

Civilizations only want a single reserve monetary base (money). Currently, we have chosen the United States Dollar as the unit of account that we are all comfortable with pricing goods and services in, globally. If this standard were to change, the only acceptable alternatives are 

1. Gold - which would be a move backwards

OR 

2. Bitcoin - Digital Gold | Gold 2.0

The only way forward.


## Products & Services

Our core product [ApnaBitcoin](https://apna.com) is a mobile application providing `self-custodian & shared-custodian bitcoin storage options; with a simplified account management interface and premium support`. Additionally, we are partnering with local excahnges to provide a simplified INR on-ramp and the option to setup recurring hourly/daily/weekly BUY's for `automatic sat stacking`.

Our services are built to comply with International Privacy and Data Security Standards such as GDPR, ISO 27001 & PCI-DSS.
Our Bitcoin operation protocol is publically auditable and developed out of the open standard Glacier Protocol & Bitcoin-Core's Hardware Wallet Interface .
