### Free & Open Source Software (Free as in Free-dom, not Free-Beer)

We love FOSS! 

FOSS empowered us to do what we do, and we want to extend that out to users.

As a user of our products & services, you can recover your coins with publicly avaiable and battle tested free and open source software.

This minimizes a users dependency on the service, and maximizes freedom.

We provide open source recovery tools and documentation hosted at GitHub, so even if we face downtime, you can use our recovery tools to operate your accounts. 

Our bitcoin-core operations (full node operations) are open sourced, giving you more guarentees on the services you are receiving AND the ability to run parts of it yourself for even higher levels of sovereignty.
