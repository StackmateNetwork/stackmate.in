### Free & Open Source Software (Free as in Free-dom, not Free-Beer)

We love FOSS! 

FOSS empowered us to do what we do, and we want to extend that out to users.

As a user of our products & services, you can recover your coins with publicly avaiable and battle tested free and open source software.

This minimizes a users dependency on the service, and maximizes freedom.

We provide open source recovery tools and documentation both in our `blog` section and soon to be hosted at GitHub, so even if we face downtime, you can use our recovery tools to operate your accounts.
