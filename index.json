	"content": "A tool for social evolution We often find ourselves projecting hatred towards money. Poverty is often seen as a side-effect of it. However, it is not money, rather FIAT money, that has created this reputation. Fiat is a fundamentally rigged system. This means, the incentives of those who take part in this system are rooted from biased first principles.\nA bitcoin standard fundamentally changes economic incentives. The debt based fiat economy is the cause of half the worlds problems today, where a few advance at the expense of the many. It is not the fault of any one single individual, rather from our collective acceptance of such a system that corrupts the incentives of man.\nFor civilization to advance, we must seek the truth, and Bitcoin has provided us with the tools and memes to begin doing so.\nBitcoin is the only instance of a decentralized \u0026amp; immutable ledger of economic activity. The digital equivalent of carving facts into stones.\nA global decentralized payment network  A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. - Nakamoto (2008)\n Bitcoin is a network of individuals (peers) maintaining a financial ledger, by a certain set of rules (consensus); thereby enforcing a protocol around it. We all collectively agree on which software to run - Bitcoin and which platforms to conduct technical \u0026amp; social discussions on - currently Github \u0026amp; Twitter.\nBitcoin peers are spread across the globe and hold common values for what constitutes a sound monetary base aka money. These values are hard to change, just like the properties of natural elements like gold. While this can make Bitcoin seem slow and boring, this is what gives it reliability.\nA chain of digital signatures  We define an electronic coin, as a chain of digital signatures. - Nakamoto (2008)\n All the way down, on the technical level. Bitcoin is a ledger of payment conditions (locks, represented by addresses). The state of this ledger can be altered by providing a valid digital signature to unlock coin and lock it to a public key of a new owner (their bitcoin address). This way, an electronic coin is represented as a constant passing on of the ability to sign on a global ledger, where your private key (a very large prime number), is essentially a special pen that can unlock a certain set of locks aka bitcoin addresses.\nA new monetary base  Precious metals and collectibles have an unforgeable scarcity due to the costliness of their creation. This once provided money the value of which was largely independent of any trusted third party. Precious metals have problems, however. It\u0026rsquo;s too costly to assay metals repeatedly for common transactions. Thus a trusted third party (usually associated with a tax collector who accepted the coins as payment) was invoked to stamp a standard amount of the metal into a coin. - Szabo (2005)\n Civilizations have always converged to a single unit of account, a monetary base unit in which to price all goods and services produced. In the past, this unit was gold. Gold found its value in its scarcity as a natural resource and expensive cost of production. Today, the US Dollar has taken the position of unit of account and finds its value purely in promisary notes and debt.\nUSD settlements take 3+ days on the base layer - fedwire.\nA visa transaction being confirmed within seconds, does not represent final settlement.\nBitcoin achieves finality within 10 minutes.\nOn top of this settlement layer, new layers can emerge, which will make various tradeoffs to cater to the specific needs of an individual.\nThe base layer, is a purely backend matter.\nOwning BTC, is taking part in consensus of a new global monetary standard.\nLayer 2 Most of us do not know, or care about (by virtue of trust in) the mechanics of the USD base layer - fedwire, which impacts the backend valuation of all our local currency transactions. In much the same way, in a Bitcoin standard, daily transactions will not require settlement or interaction on the base layer from the user\u0026rsquo;s end.\nDaily transactions will take place on Layer 2 or sidechains.\nThe ledger on the base layer only allows 1MB of data to be entered every 10 minutes.\nA single transaction is roughly 200B on average.\nNow, this transaction could either be one of two cases:\n Private Key Lock - Requires an individual to sign in order to move coins Script Lock - Requires a more complex condition to be satisfied to move coins  Most of us are familiar with the first case, which is a regular case of Alice paying Bob. It takes 10 minutes, and that is too slow for daily transctions, especially if Alice and Bob regularly transact.\nThis is where we mpve into layer 2, where spending conditions involving multiple parties can be created which can provide enough guarentees to all parties to conduct activity on a side-chain or another protocol that can make sense of this Script Lock.\nThis is how bitcoin scales.\nWhere 200B can represent a 1-to-1 payment, servicing only two individuals in a Private Key Lock, the same 200B can represent a multi-party payment channel, servicing any number of individuals to transact at lightning speed and with as much frequency as they so chose in - on a side-chain that is secured by a Script Lock bitcoin transaction on the main chian.\nAlice and Bob can transact at almost no fees, almost instantaneouly on a side-chain where all their micro transactions then finally get summed and settle on the main chain into a 200B tx that encapsulated long periods of off-chain activity; with the added side effect of privacy over micro transactions.\nExamples of this include:\n Lightning Network WBTC on Ethereum/Cardano etc.  The bitcoin base layer must always support decentralization, which means keeping the size of blocks small so that new peers can join the network and easily run a full node and maintain a copy of the entire ledger.\nThis protects the network for coordinated attacks and ensures much higher availability and reliability than any centralized or weakly decentralized system.\nMORE Want to go deeper down the rabbit hole?\nTune in with these repositories of content from the Bitcoin Core network:\nEssential Listening Bitcoin Audible\nEssential Reading Nakamoto Institute\nSwan Signal\n"

	"content": "Not your keys, not your coin.  You either protect your money via crypto keys and proof-of-work, or, you protect it with physical vaults and lethal weapons. There is no third option. - Lombrozo (2021)\n Bitcoin storage can be broadly classified into three, ranked based on expected features:\n Rank #1 is best\n    Features Custodian Self-Custody Shared-Custody     Definition Coins held by a bank on your behalf. Coins held by you alone. Coins held by you AND your partner(s), based on pre-defined conditions.   Ease-of-use 1 2 3*   Privacy 3 1 2   Security 3 2 1     Most of us are familiar with the first two models.\nAll exchange wallets provide custodian wallets.\nGreen, Samourai, Wasabi etc., are examples of self-custody wallets; where you are the sole bearer of the keys.\nBoth custodian and self-custodian models present the problem of being single points of failure.\nEither your exchange OR you, could get compromised.\nShared-Custody Our mobile wallet, at its core, seeks to to provide greater Ease-of-Use for shared-custody wallets. With shared custody, coins are locked by MORE THAN ONE KEY.\nThis means - a single compromised key does not result in loss of funds\nWe allow you to appoint ANY other Bitcoin holder to take part in a scripted Bitcoin contract, and create additional layers of protection around your Bitcoin.\nYou can pair the mobile wallet with your existing hardware to monitor a solo account, generate addresses to receive funds, monitor history and even build transactions* for you to sign as an individual key holder and broadcast.\n ** PartiallySignedBitcoinTransaction or psbt is representation of a bitcoin transaction, which can be created with only public key data. This psbt can then passed to the approriate private key holder to sign and broadcast. We work seamlessly with any wallet that supports psbt.\n Additionally, the same hardware public key can be used to create a new multi-sig contract with another friend\u0026rsquo;s hardware as the second signatory.\nThis new multi-sig contract will generate its own set of addresses into which you can receive funds.\nThis allows you to create multiple contracts from a single hardware signer, each with different spending conditions involving other bitcoiners.\nThe mobile wallet pairs best with ColdCard or Trezor. Moving these funds will require an initiating party to sign a psbt and pass over to the next signatory to finalize and broadbast to the network.\nMulti-Signature The most common form of a shared-custody contract is a multi-signature.\nMulti-signature is a spending condition where more than one key has to sign a transaction to move the coin locked in these addresses.\nThis means there are n/m possibilities of multi-sig. So we made it simple.\nWe offer three types of multi-signature configurations as paid services: *The cost of paid services half every successive year of subscription.*\nJetski 2/3 Multi-Sig w/server Built for individuals  Est. August 18, 2021\n In this setup, you maintain control of 2/3 keys, where one key is on your mobile device for easy signing, and the other key is in your cold hardware, just to use incase of emergency.\nFor daily spending, your mobile key and our server as an automated signatory, can move funds.\nIf you lose your mobile and/or its associated seed, you can still recover it with your hardware wallet and our signature.\n Multi-sig that feels like a single sig. With taproot support in progress, this will soon even look like single sig.\n Cost: 120,000 sats/year\nCheaper than a Netflix subscription\nYacht [3-4]/5 Multi-Sig (server optional) Built for households and small businesses  Est. September 18, 2021\n The same setup as above with:\n 5 key threshold extended support over Jitsi 1 hardware wallet of choice between Trezor (Beginner) OR ColdCard (Advanced)  Cost: 3 million sats/year\nSubmarine [5-9]/12 Multi-Sig Built for enterprise.  Est. September 18, 2021\n The same setup as above with:\n 9 key threshold custom scripts and specialized bitcoin infrastructure premium support over Signal w/a dedicated account manager. 3 hardware wallets of choice between Trezor (Beginner) OR ColdCard (Advanced)  Cost: 9 million sats/year\nTimelocks Another form of shared-custody contract is a timelock.\nBitcoin allows us to create spending conditions that will alter over time.\nSimilar to multi-sigs; there a large number of arbitrary possibilites with timelocks, so we condensed it down to a few:\nRaft Built for everyone  Est. December 09, 2021.\n  The reason this is last on our roadmap is because it requires an update from bitcoin-core. Hang in there ;)\n In this setup, you set a time in the future as a failsafe timelock. Appoint another Bitcoiner to be your raft partner by requesting their public key. Allow only yourself to move the funds at any point in time and allow your partner to move the coin ONLY AFTER the timelock.\nUse cases of this include\nappoint your own trusted custodian to act as a backup service to be able to unlock your coin after a timelock, in the event that you lose your keys.\ncreate a will or inheritence plan, where rather than sharing copies of your seed(subject to the angry rogue son problem), you create a more sovereign contract for your wealth to be securely handed down.\nCost: : FREE Subscription Terms Your subscription is primarily for support and the monitoring features on our mobile wallet. Your funds are not LOCKED; if you are overdue on fees or otherwise. You will just be restricted from paid support channels and mobile monitoring. Ultimately, you are in control of your coin, and you only pay us for support and convenience.\n"
