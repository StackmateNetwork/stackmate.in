	"content": "Bitcoin Storage Models Bitcoin storage can be broadly classified into three, ranked based on expected features:\n   Features Custodian Self-Custody Shared-Custody     Definition Coins held by your partner on your behalf. Coins held by you alone. Coins held by you AND a your partner(s), based on pre-defined conditions.   Ease-of-use 1 2 3*   Privacy 3 1 2   Security 3 2 1     Most of us are familiar with the first two models.\nAll exchange wallets provide custodian wallets.\nGreen, Samourai, Wasabi etc., are examples of self-custody wallets; where you are the sole bearer of the keys.\nBoth custodian and self-custodian models present the problem of being single points of failure.\nEither your exchange OR you, could get compromised.\nShared-Custody Our mobile wallet, at its core, seeks to to provide greater Ease-of-Use for shared-custody wallets. With shared custody, coins are locked by MORE THAN ONE KEY - offering the highest levels of security Bitcoin has to offer.\nWith shared-custody - a single compromised key does not result in loss of funds\nWe allow you to appoint ANY other Bitcoin holder to take part in a scripted Bitcoin contract, and create additional layers of protection around your Bitcoin.\nYou can pair the mobile wallet with your existing hardware to monitor a solo account, generate addresses to receive funds, monitor history and even build transactions* for you to sign as an individual key holder and broadcast.\n ** PartiallySignedBitcoinTransaction or psbt is how we build transactions with only public key data; preparing it for the private key holder to sign. We work seamlessly with any wallet that supports psbt.\n Additionally, the same hardware public key can be used to create a new multi-sig wallet with another friend\u0026rsquo;s hardware as the second signatory.\nThis new multi-sig wallet will generate its own set of addresses into which you can receive funds.\nThis allows you to create multiple wallets from a single hardware signer, each with different spending conditions involving other bitcoiners.\nThe mobile wallet pairs best with ColdCard or Trezor. Moving these funds will require an initiating party to sign and pass over to the next, a psbt to finalize and broadbast to the network.\nOur servers only require your public keys to help you manage your account. You and your chosen signatories\u0026rsquo; are the sole custodians of the coin.\nWhere you chose our server to be a signatory, it only maintains ITS OWN private key, and all other signatories\u0026rsquo; public keys.\nMulti-Signature The most common form of a shared-custody contract is a multi-signature.\nMulti-signature is a spending condition where more than one key has to sign a transaction to move the coin locked in these addresses.\nThis means there are n/m possibilities of multi-sig. So we made it simple.\nWe offer three types of multi-signature configurations as paid services: Jetski 2/3 Multi-Sig w/server Built for individuals  Est. August 18, 2021\n In this setup, you maintain control of 2/3 keys, where one key is on your mobile device for easy signing, and the other key is in your cold hardware, just to use incase of emergency.\nFor daily spending, your mobile key and our server as an automated signatory, can move funds.\nIf you lose your mobile and/or its associated seed, you can still recover it with your hardware wallet and our signature.\n Multi-sig that feels like a single sig. With taproot support in progress, this will soon even look like single sig.\n Cost: 420,000 sats/year\nYacht [3-4]/5 Multi-Sig (server optional) Built for households and small businesses  Est. September 18, 2021\n The same setup as above with:\n 5 key threshold extended support over Jitsi 1 hardware wallet of choice between Trezor (Beginner) OR ColdCard (Advanced)  Cost: 3 million sats/year\nSubmarine [5-9]/12 Multi-Sig Built for enterprise.  Est. September 18, 2021\n The same setup as above with:\n 9 key threshold custom scripts and specialized bitcoin infrastructure premium support over Signal w/a dedicated account manager. 3 hardware wallets of choice between Trezor (Beginner) OR ColdCard (Advanced)  Cost: 9 million sats/year\nTimelocks Another form of shared-custody contract is a timelock.\nBitcoin allows us to create spending conditions that will alter over time.\nSimilar to multi-sigs; there a large number of arbitrary possibilites with timelocks, so we condensed it down to a few:\nRaft Built for everyone  Est. December 09, 2021.\n  The reason this is lasts is because it requires an update from bitcoin-core. Hang in there ;)\n In this setup, you set a time in the future as a failsafe timelock. Appoint another Bitcoiner to be your raft partner by requesting their public key. Allow only yourself to move the funds at any point in time and allow your partner to move the coin ONLY AFTER the timelock.\nUse cases of this include\nappoint your own trusted custodian to act as a backup service to be able to unlock your coin after a timelock, in the event that you lose your keys.\ncreate a will or inheritence plan, where rather than sharing copies of your seed(subject to the angry rogue son problem), you create a more sovereign contract for your wealth to be securely handed down.\nCost: : FREE "

In such cases, personal data on a user is encrypted at rest with a password set by the user - preventing even us from accessing it without the user decrypting it. If a user find\u0026rsquo;s this causing an inconvenience, they are easily able to opt-out.\n  We will not share a users peronally identifiable information with any third party without the consent of the user. Where an extended service requires sharing information with a third-party that does not offer the same degrees of privacy, we will clearly present the risks to you prior to requesting your consent.\n  Users have the ability to delete their accounts, and completely purge all traces of personally identifiable information (from backups too!) that can associate user identity with our transaction data.\n  With respect to bitcoin, by sharing your xpub with our server and associating it with an email and source IP, you are fingerprinting all related transaction data. You can work around this by using a private email and running our client behing Tor. Additionally, the option to delete your account allows you to return to a more private state. Deleted accounts can be recovered by importing the same public key again with the rescan option.\n  "
